      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! I'm someone who’s always up for a good laugh and easy to get along with. People often say I'm the kind of person who can bring positive energy into any room and I take that as a compliment!
      </p>
      <p>
        I love creating cinematic videos and short movies storytelling through visuals is my passion. Whether it’s capturing a quiet moment or building an epic scene, I’m always chasing that perfect shot.
      </p>
      <p>
        And yes, if you're wondering. I absolutely love <strong>nasi goreng</strong>. It fuels my creativity (and my stomach).
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's connect and maybe work on something awesome together!

    <h3>How I Became Now</h3>
    <p>
      I used to be just an ordinary student who got up early, went to school, came home tired, and then repeated the same day. I had no vision, just living because I had to. But somehow, underneath that boredom, there was a curiosity that slowly grew: “What exactly can I achieve if I dare to try?” The journey began when I fell, got bad grades, was underestimated, and even wanted to give up. However, behind the failures, I began to learn the meaning of process. From learning technical things like coding, to recognizing myself, everything opened up a path that once seemed impossible. Now I stand in a new world as a student. Not because I'm the smartest, but because I haven't stopped walking. The journey isn't over yet, but I know that I'm no longer the same student. I'm becoming the best version of “me now”.

    <h3>How to Fight Laziness</h3>
    <p>
      The simple way to fight it is to start small, like clearing your desk or opening your paperwork. Use the Pomodoro technique (25 minutes work, 5 minutes break) to stay focused. Keep distractions like your phone or TV away, and keep your goals in mind. After completing the task, give yourself a small reward as a token of appreciation.

    <h3>How to be Consistent</h3>
    <p>
      Consistency is the key to progress, and the way to maintain it starts with clear intentions. Create specific and realistic goals, then break them down into small tasks that can be done every day. Schedule your routine at the same time to make it a habit. Don't focus on the big results first, but celebrate small progress. If you get bored or tired, remember why you started. Consistency isn't about being perfect every day, it's about getting back to it even when you stop.
